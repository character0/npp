#Create a query table for all airport codes. Should include airport ID and/or name and departure time. Insertion maintains
order. Can insert by DEP_TIME to keep sorted or create composite key and order on that.

CREATE TABLE allFlightsForATL (
      ORIGIN_AIRPORT_ID int,
      DEP_TIME timestamp;
      PRIMARY KEY (ORIGIN_AIRPORT_ID, DEP_TIME)
) with clustering order by (DEP_TIME asc)

CREATE TABLE flightsInNext10Minutes (

      CARRIER varchar,
      ORIGIN varchar,
      DEST varchar,
);

#Use getSlice() to pull 10 minute buckets of AIR_TIME.
