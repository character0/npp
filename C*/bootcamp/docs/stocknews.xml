  <title>Fitch: Activist Investor Activity Distracts U.S. Restaurants</title>
  <id>1</id>
  <symbol></symbol>
    <date>Jan 13, 2014</date>
    <text xml:space="preserve">
NEW YORK, Jan 13, 2014 (BUSINESS WIRE) --
Increased activist investor activity in the restaurant space portends change for 
the U.S. restaurant industry and is a testament to the fact that shareholder 
demands continue to rise despite challenging operating conditions, according to 
Fitch Ratings. Darden Restaurants Inc. (Darden), Bob Evans Farms, Inc., and 
Cracker Barrel remain under pressure as a function of this type of activity. 
Fitch does not immediately factor threats from activist investors into ratings 
since many overtures are unsuccessful but continually monitors developments to 
adjust ratings should changes in operating or financial strategy become likely. 
However, we take activist investor activity very seriously, as it is a huge 
distraction to management with proposals having the potential to significantly 
increase leverage in order to reward shareholders. The presence of activist 
investors therefore raises event risk for creditors. 
Fitch placed Darden's ratings on Rating Watch Negative in December 2013 
following the company's announced strategic actions, the most significant of 
which is the potential separation of Red Lobster and downward revision of fiscal 
2013 earnings. Darden's was downgraded to 'BBB-' from 'BBB' in October 2013 due 
to persistently weak same-restaurant sales, declining operating income, and 
because leverage and free cash flow (FCF) would not improve as fast as 
originally anticipated. The separation of Red Lobster should result in more 
stable operating cash flow and higher margins but Olive Garden continues to 
experience serious pressure and will represent the preponderance of the firm's 
sales and operating cash flow over the intermediate term. Moreover, due to 
potential for a still high dividend payout, uncertainty remains as to the timing 
of any meaningful improvement in FCF. 
Although no final decision has been made on the form of separation which is 
targeted for completion early in the fiscal 2015 year that begins May 26, 2014, 
Darden expects to execute a tax-free spin-off of Red Lobster to shareholders but 
may also consider a direct sale. The spin-off is subject to final approval by 
Darden's board of directors, confirmation of the tax-free nature, and other 
customary conditions. We believe the Red Lobster separation is motivated by a 
combination of Darden's longer term views regarding requirements for Red Lobster 
to be successful and agitation by activist investors. We also believe the 
separation is likely to be completed but are concerned that an additional 
activist investor has taken a meaningful stake in order to push for further 
changes to enhance shareholder value. 
In addition to Barrington Capital Group, LP (Barrington), which owns 2.8% of 
Darden's common stock and went public with its proposals in September 2013, 
Starboard Value LP (Starboard) disclosed a 5.6% stake in the restaurant chain on 
Dec. 23, 2013, a week after Darden announced its strategic initiatives. 
Barrington proposes that Darden unlock value for shareholders by creating two 
independent publicly traded operating companies and monetizing its real estate 
via a private sales-leaseback transaction or a public REIT. One operating 
company would consist of Darden's faster growing LongHorn Steakhouse and 
Specialty Restaurant Group while the other would manage the firm's mature Olive 
Garden and Red Lobster brands. Both Barrington and Starboard view Darden's plan 
to separate Red Lobster as incomplete and inadequate, mainly because the company 
is not looking to monetize its real estate holdings, and are seeking further 
discussions with management. At the fiscal year ended May 26, 2013, Darden owned 
the land for 49% of its 2,138 restaurants and has indicated that real estate 
related to Red Lobster will be included in its separation.

  <title>How to Use PPI in Forex Trading</title>
  <id>4</id>
  <symbol></symbol>
    <date>Jan 13, 2014</date>
    <text xml:space="preserve">
Talking Points 
PPI stands for the Producer Price Index. 
PPI comes out the second week of each month. 
Forex traders can use PPI as a leading indicator to forecast consumer inflation 
measured by the Consumer Price Index (CPI) 
In the 1950's gasoline was $0.27, apartment rent was $42/month and a movie 
ticket was $0.48. In addition, the US dollar was worth 9 times what is worth 
now. Inflation reduces domestic buying power and that is why central banks fight 
so hard to beat back inflation by raising the interest rate. Forex traders are 
well aware that interest rates are the main driver of currency movement. 
Investors seek higher yields and will migrate capital from low yielding assets 
and currencies to high yielding assets and currencies. This is why traders pay 
special attention to the Producer Price Index because it alerts them to the rise 
and fall of inflation which could, in turn, lead to a rise and fall of currency 
rates. 
What is PPI? 
Released monthly in the second week of each month, the Producer Price Index 
(PPI) is an indicator used to measure the average change in selling price, over 
time, received for finished goods.Retailers that have to pay more for finished 
goods may have to pass on higher costs to consumers. This measurement of price 
change from the view of the seller can be a leading indicator for consumer 
inflation that is measured by the Consumer Price Index (CPI). PPI examines three 
production areas; commodity-based, industrial-based, and 
stage-of-processing-based companies. Released by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, 
PPI is created using data collected from a mailed survey of retailers selected 
randomly. Traders can see changes in PPI expressed in a percentage change from 
the previous year or month to month. 
Why Look at PPI? 
Forex traders use the Producer Price Index to find the direction of prices and a 
measurement of inflation. Rising prices in the form of inflation lowers the 
purchasing power of a country's currency because consumers can buy less goods 
and services for each unit of currency. This decrease in consumer buying power 
usually triggers a central bank response to raise interest rates. A rising PPI 
could indicate that consumer prices could rise leading to higher interest rates. 
The increase in interest rates stimulates the demand for that currency as 
investors chase yield. This inflow of capital results in a higher exchange rate. 
On the other hand, a stable or falling PPI insures that interest rates will 
remain low. This results in a lower relative currency exchange rate. As you can 
see, using the information found in PPI can give traders an advantage when 
seeking out strong and weak currencies.

  <title>Gold Looks to Fed-Speak as Markets Weigh QE Tapering Prospects</title>
  <id>5</id>

    <text xml:space="preserve">

Talking Points: 
Fed Officials' Commentary in Focus, Lockhart Initially in the Spotlight 
Gold May Rise if QE Tapering Comes into Question After Soft NFP Data 
Crude Oil to Fall in With Risk Appetite Trends, Downside Bias Hinted 
"Fed-speak" is in the spotlight this week as markets ponder Friday's deeply 
disappointing US employment data and the possibility that it may compel the FOMC 
to rethink the decision to begin "tapering" QE asset purchases. While 
policymakers seem unlikely to abandon their medium-term strategy on the basis of 
one data point, speculation is likely to run rampant nonetheless. 
Atlanta Fed President Dennis Lockhart will kick things off in the hours ahead. 
Signs of a dovish rhetorical shift that stresses the data dependence of future 
QE withdrawal and reiterates the possibility that the process may be slowed or 
halted may rekindle fears of US Dollar dilution via longer- lasting 
accommodation and boost anti-fiat demand for gold, pushing prices higher. 
Commentary reinforcing the status quo stands to have the opposite effect. 
The implications for crude oil are less clear-cut. The WTI contract has once 
again developed a formidable correlation to the S and P 500, a benchmark for risk 
appetite trends. However, it seems the US jobs report did little to offer 
directional cues to sentiment, with the stock index still locked in a familiar 
range. For what it's worth, S and P 500 futures are pointing sharply lower ahead of 
the opening bell on Wall Street, hinting oil may be setting up to follow shares 
downward. 
Capitalize on Shifts in Market Mood with the DailyFX Speculative Sentiment 
Index. 
CRUDE OIL TECHNICAL ANALYSIS - Prices fell as expected after putting in a 
Bearish Engulfing candlestick pattern. A break below 91.74 - the November 27 
swing low - exposes the 50% Fibonacci expansion at 90.50. Reversing back above 
92.91, the 38.2% level, aims for the 23.6% Fib at 95.90. 
GOLD TECHNICAL ANALYSIS - Prices turned higher as expected after putting in a 
Harami candlestick pattern. A break above resistance in the 1217.75-22.01 area, 
marked by the December 2 low and the 23.6% Fibonacci retracement, has exposed 
the 38.2% level at 1248.70. A further push beyond that aims for the 
1261.28-70.28 region, bracketed by the October 11 swing low and the 50% Fib.

  <title>North American Palladium Announces Proposed Financing</title>
  <id>6</id>
  <symbol>TSX:PAL</symbol>
    <date>Jan 13, 2014</date>
    <text xml:space="preserve">
TORONTO, ONTARIO, Jan 13, 2014 (Marketwired via COMTEX) --
All figures are in Canadian dollars except where noted. 
North American Palladium Ltd. ("NAP" or the "Company") (TSX:PDL)(NYSE MKT:PAL) 
announced today that it has commenced marketing in connection with a public 
offering of securities (the "Offering"). 
The Offering is expected to be conducted in two tranches. The first tranche 
("Tranche 1") is anticipated to be $30 million aggregate principal amount of 
7.5% convertible unsecured subordinated debentures (the "Tranche 1 Debentures") 
due the fifth anniversary of the issue date. The second tranche ("Tranche 2") is 
anticipated to be between $20 million and $45 million aggregate principal amount 
of securities comprised of (i) 7.5% convertible unsecured subordinated 
debentures (the "Tranche 2 Debentures", together with the Tranche 1 Debentures, 
the "Debentures") of the Company due on the fifth anniversary of the issue date 
and (ii) warrants expiring three years from the date of issue ("Tranche 2 
Warrants", together with the Debentures, the "Offered Securities"). The Tranche 
2 Warrants will represent the right to purchase an aggregate number of common 
shares of the Company ("Common Shares") equal to 33% of the number of Common 
Shares into which the Debentures are convertible (excluding Common Shares 
issuable as interest or as a make whole payment) at an exercise price equal to 
120% of the conversion price of the Tranche 2 Debentures. Edgecrest Capital 
Corporation has been retained as lead placement agent and sole bookrunner for a 
syndicate to be formed (the "Lead Agent"). 
The Offering will be conducted in the United States pursuant to the Company's 
effective shelf registration statement filed with the U.S. Securities and 
Exchange Commission ("SEC") and in Canada pursuant to its existing final short 
form base shelf prospectus filed with the securities regulatory authorities in 
each of the Provinces of Canada. The aggregate amount of Debentures to be issued 
and the conversion price at which such Debentures will be convertible into 
Common Shares will be determined prior to the time of filing the final 
prospectus supplement for each of Tranche 1 and Tranche 2. 
The Company also announced it has secured a non-binding commitment to purchase 
$40 million of the Offered Securities ($20 million in respect of each of Tranche 
1 and Tranche 2) from Crede CG III, Ltd, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Crede 
Capital Group, llc, a US-based family office. 
It is anticipated that Tranche 1 will close on or about January 23, 2014. In the 
event that the Toronto Stock Exchange or NYSE MKT requires shareholder approval 
in order to issue the securities in connection with Tranche 2, such approval 
will be sought at a meeting to be held on or about March 18, 2014 with closing 
of Tranche 2 anticipated on or about March 27, 2014 subject to the satisfaction 
of to be agreed upon closing conditions. If shareholder approval is not required 
Tranche 2 is expected to close concurrently with Tranche 1, or as soon as 
practicable thereafter. 
The proceeds from the Offering are expected to be used for general corporate 
purposes. 
The Offered Securities will not be listed on either the TSX or NYSE MKT. The 
Company intends to apply to list on the TSX and NYSE MKT the Common Shares 
issuable pursuant to the terms of the Offered Securities. 
The Company has filed a final base shelf prospectus and will file an indicative 
term sheet with the securities regulatory authorities in each of the provinces 
of Canada and an indicative term sheet and registration statement (including a 
base prospectus) with the SEC for the Offering. The Company will also file a 
final prospectus supplement containing important information relating to the 
securities described in this document with the securities regulatory authorities 
in each of the Provinces of Canada and with the SEC. The offering in Canada will 
be made only by the base shelf prospectus and the relevant final prospectus 
supplement. Before you invest, you should read the base shelf prospectus, the 
registration statement and the final prospectus supplement and other documents
